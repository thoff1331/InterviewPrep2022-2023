Echo prints in the terminal whatever parameter we pass it.

echo Hello freeCodeCamp! // Output: Hello freeCodeCamp!

pwd stands for print working directory and it prints the "place" or directory we are currently at in the computer.

ls presents you the contents of the directory you're currently in. It will present you with both the files and other directories your current directory contains.

cd is short for Change directory and it will take you from your current directory to another.

mkdir stands for make directory and it will create a new directory for you. You have to pass the command the directory name parameter.

rmdir stands for Remove directory and it does just that. It needs the directory name parameter just as mkdir: rmdir test.

touch allows you to create an empty file in your current directory. As parameters it takes the file name, like touch test.txt.

rm allows you to delete files, in the same way rmdir allows you to remove directories.
rm test.txt

cp allows you to copy files or directories. This command takes two parameters: the first one is the file or directory you want to copy, and the second one is the destination of your copy (where do you want to copy your file/directory to).

mv is short for move, and lets us move a file or directory from one place to another. That is, create it in a new directory and delete it in the previous one (same as you could do by cutting and pasting).

What is node ?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.

Some of its advantages include:

It is generally fast
It rarely blocks
It offers a unified programming language and data type
Everything is asynchronous 
It yields great concurrency

A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking.  Being an asynchronous platform, Node.js heavily relies on callback. All APIs of Node are written to support callbacks.

Core Modules	Description

What are the modules in Node.js?
Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. To include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parentheses containing the module's name.


HTTP:	The HTTP module includes classes, methods, and events to create a Node.js HTTP server.
util:	The util module includes utility functions required in the application and is very useful for developers.
url:	The url module is used to include the methods for URL parsing.
fs:	The fs module includes events, classes, and methods to handle the file I/O operations.
stream:	The stream module is used to include the methods to handle streaming data.
query string:	The query string module is used to include the methods to work with a query string.
zlib:	The zlib module is used to include the methods to compress or decompress the files used in an application.

 What does event-driven programming mean?
An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered.


What is an Event Loop in Node.js?

Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.


 Differentiate between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?

The distinction between method and product. This is accomplished through the use of nextTick() and setImmediate(). next Tick() postpones the execution of action until the next pass around the event loop, or it simply calls the callback function once the event loop's current execution is complete, whereas setImmediate() executes a callback on the next cycle of the event loop and returns control to the event loop for any I/O operations.

What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?


EventEmitter is a class that holds all the objects that can emit events
Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously

Node.js Interview Questions and Answers For Freshers
This section will provide you with the Basic Node.js interview questions which will primarily help freshers.

1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client’s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications.

Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model. You can use  I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites. You can also use it for developing: Real-time web applications, Network applications, General-purpose applications, and Distributed systems.

2. Why use Node.js?
Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include:

It is generally fast
It rarely blocks
It offers a unified programming language and data type
Everything is asynchronous 
It yields great concurrency
3. How does Node.js work?
A web server using Node.js typically has a workflow that is quite similar to the diagram illustrated below. Let’s explore this flow of operations in detail.

Node.js Architecture Workflow

Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking:
Querying for data
Deleting data 
Updating the data
Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue
The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources
The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations), such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients
A single thread from the Thread Pool is assigned to a single complex request. This thread is responsible for completing a particular blocking request by accessing external resources, such as computation, database, file system, etc.

Once the task is carried out completely, the response is sent to the Event Loop that sends that response back to the client.

4. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?
Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.

5. If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?
The Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model is not followed by the Node JS Platform, and it adheres to the Single-Threaded Event Loop Model. The Node JS Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. As a result, Node.js can easily manage more concurrent client requests. The event loop is the processing model's beating heart in Node.js.

6. Explain callback in Node.js.
A callback function is called after a given task. It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking.  Being an asynchronous platform, Node.js heavily relies on callback. All APIs of Node are written to support callbacks.

7. What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?
The control flow of asynchronous logic is more specified and structured.
The coupling is low.
We've built-in error handling.
Improved readability.
8. How would you define the term I/O? 
The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a medium and to or from another medium
Every transfer is an output from one medium and an input into another. The medium can be a physical device, network, or files within a system
io

9. How is Node.js most frequently used?
Node.js is widely used in the following applications:

Real-time chats
Internet of Things
Complex SPAs (Single-Page Applications)
Real-time collaboration tools
Streaming applications
Microservices architecture
10. Explain the difference between frontend and backend development?
Front-end

Back-end

Frontend refers to the client-side of an application

Backend refers to the server-side of an application

It is the part of a web application that users can see and interact with

It constitutes everything that happens behind the scenes

It typically includes everything that attributes to the visual aspects of a web application

It generally includes a web server that communicates with a database to serve requests

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, and ReactJS are some of the essentials of frontend development

Java, PHP, Python, and Node.js are some of the backend development technologies

Spawn() launches a new process with the available set of commands.

Multiple workers run on a single node code base for multiple tasks.

This method doesn’t generate a new V8 instance, and only a single copy of the node module is active on the processor.

39. What is the buffer class in Node.js?
Buffer class stores raw data similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap. Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data

40. What is piping in Node.js?
Piping is a mechanism used to connect the output of one stream to another stream. It is normally used to retrieve data from one stream and pass output to another stream

41. What are some of the flags used in the read/write operations in files?
flags

42. How do you open a file in Node.js?
openfile

43. What is callback hell?
Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is the result of intensively nested, unreadable, and unmanageable callbacks, which in turn makes the code harder to read and debug
improper implementation of the asynchronous logic causes callback hell
44. What is a reactor pattern in Node.js?
A reactor pattern is a concept of non-blocking I/O operations. This pattern provides a handler that is associated with each I/O operation. As soon as an I/O request is generated, it is then submitted to a demultiplexer

45. What is a test pyramid in Node.js?
test-pyramid

46. For Node.js, why does Google use the V8 engine?
The V8 engine, developed by Google, is open-source and written in C++. Google Chrome makes use of this engine. V8, unlike the other engines, is also utilized for the popular Node.js runtime. V8 was initially intended to improve the speed of JavaScript execution within web browsers. Instead of employing an interpreter, V8 converts JavaScript code into more efficient machine code to increase performance. It turns JavaScript code into machine code during execution by utilizing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, as do many current JavaScript engines such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla).


48. Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.
Middleware is a function that receives the request and response objects. Most tasks that the middleware functions perform are:  

Execute any code
Update or modify the request and the response objects
Finish the request-response cycle
Invoke the next middleware in the stack

What are the different types of HTTP requests?

HTTP defines a set of request methods used to perform desired actions. The request methods include:

GET: Used to retrieve the data

POST: Generally used to make a change in state or reactions on the server

HEAD: Similar to the GET method, but asks for the response without the response body

DELETE: Used to delete the predetermined resource
